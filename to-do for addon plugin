So here are the tasks. I will create a doc as well in sometime.
Create a new plugin called "Robodesk Addon"
Create a post type "Queries"
Add meta fields "Name", "Email", "Converted to FAQ?  (This will be checkbox)
The add on should take styling and functionality from the free plugin.
The plugin should be activable only when Robodesk is active.
When this addon in active, the form that you built on Robodesk should save the queries to the newly created post type.
Do not re-do the form on this addon Use the same form fro the main plugin. Just add to its functionality.




robodesk tickets add on
if that email is already exist ask please login for register user

when user ask question after sending query show related question like search 
when we back to your query please find this faq which may be help full
